# compilation #
g++/clang++ main.cpp utils.cpp -o out/out

# requirements #
terminal with a UTF-8 encoding (to support the cool box effects)

# FOR WINDOWS USERS ON TERMINAL #
the command prompt might not show unicode characters properly
the lazy fix is to type `chcp 65001` on every terminal boot
further information to fix this can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388490/how-can-i-use-unicode-characters-on-the-windows-command-line)



smaller project for a future one -
multidimensional connect 4

gonna train a neural network to play against itself
